# VueJS Training - Daily Report

A simple web app that connect to Google Sheet and read/write data, using Google APIs. The team members will use this to write daily report at the end of the day, instead of posting daily report directly into group chat.

## Setup New Project Codes
First step is to create your project folder and modify the .gitignore file to exclude unneeded file if neccessary.

```bash
# create new vue project using vue-cli command
$ vue create your_project_folder_name

#move to your project source code
$ cd your_project_folder_name
```

## Task Lists
1. Create a new page that contains an input form for user to write daily report, similar to this google form: https://forms.gle/Hh7XeRd9gjYFYMAq9

2. Using Google API (example project: https://gitlab.com/training-practical-guides/vnv-ts-template/-/tree/google-api-spreadsheets), setup and config to connect to the data sheet(you might need to request access if needed): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DhDezMWlCXqNBsVOvZ8GBTQZ5otcPdKp48JdLu4QByI/

3. Using input form at task 1, try to record some report into the sheet database.

4. Coming soon...
